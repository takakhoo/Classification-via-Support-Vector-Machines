# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a binary classification task using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). It explores both linear and nonlinear decision boundaries and highlights key properties of margin maximization and kernel transformation.

## ðŸ§  Objective

To understand how SVMs function as a maximum-margin classifier and visualize the impact of varying margins, slack variables, and kernels.

## ðŸ“˜ Concepts Covered

- Hard-margin and soft-margin SVMs
- Hinge loss and regularization
- Dual formulation and Lagrange multipliers
- RBF (Gaussian) kernel transformation
- Support vectors and margin analysis

## ðŸ“Š Visuals

The notebook includes decision boundary plots, margin visualizations, and annotated graphs that demonstrate how SVMs behave under different hyperparameter configurations.

## ðŸ“Ž Requirements

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `seaborn`
- `jupyter`

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Open the notebook and run all cells. You can change kernel types and slack parameters to observe how the classifier adapts.
